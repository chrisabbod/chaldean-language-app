In English, the word ‘or’ is used quite often, to differentiate between this or that. In Surath, the translation of the word ‘or’ is ‘yen’. So, if you see the word yen written anywhere, you will know what it means.",

To pronounce this letter, press the middle of the tongue against the roof of the mouth a little farther back than the teeth. This is not your standard T sound.

A secondary reason for this is that, unlike English but very similar to Spanish and many other languages, the conjugation of the verb in Surath implies which pronoun should be used.\n\nCOMPARISON AND CONTRAST\nIn English, the same verb is used for I, you, he, she, and they, which makes the personal pronoun incredibly important to the meaning of the verb when used in a sentence:\n\nI went\nShe went\nThey went\nWe went\n\nWhereas in Spanish, the verb changes as it is conjugated, so the pronoun can be omitted:\n\nI went - fui\nHe went - fue\nThey went - fueron\nWe went - fuimos\n\nI believe that most languages are conjugated more similarly to Surath (or Spanish) than English.

The verb ‘to be’ is conjugated in the present tense, but in Surath, the infinitive of the verb is not used. Generally, a prefix of ‘bee’ is added onto the verb’s root, and sometimes a vowel added onto the end of the root, thus creating the progressive tense.\n\nSo, in Surath, to make a regular verb progressive, you want to use the following formula:\n\n[hwa (conjugated in the present tense)] + [bee]+[infinitive]a\n\nHopefully that makes some sense to the readers.",
